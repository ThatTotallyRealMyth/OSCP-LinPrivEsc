# OSCP-LinPrivEsc
A Linux Privilege Escalation cheatsheet I made prepping for the OSCP and beyond. Having done over 40 boxes on VirtualHacking Labs, a little over 10 on PG and the OSCP challenge labs; I came across a nice range of pirlivge escalation vectors that I tried my best to document. 

The cheatsheet may not be fully comprehensive but I think it really does come close. I have yet to experince a box(my OSCP exam included) in which my cheatsheet was not sufficient in giving both the exploit path but also being a reference on how to exploit it. I am hoping others
may benefit from it too!

If you find an OSCP challenge lab or HTB/THM box in which this sheet provided no leads then let me know and Ill figure out how to plug that gap! Im hoping this repo will continue to be refined with more techniques, more specific methods for detection and exploitation!
